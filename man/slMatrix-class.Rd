\title{Class "slMatrix" }
\description{ \code{slMatrix} is a matrix-like object for storing values
  of periodic autocovariance functions, i.e. of functions of two
  arguments which are periodic in the first argument,
  \code{r[t,k]=r[t+d,k]}. The first argument has the meaning of "time" or
  "season" (when taken modulo the period),
  the second is "lag".
  This class provides various access and assignment methods for
  such objects. slMatrix was created as the storage for values of
  periodic autocovariance functions and is used for other related quantities.
}
\section{Objects from the Class}{
  Objects can be created by calls of the form \code{new("slMatrix", m)},
  where \code{m} is a matrix with m[i,k] giving the values for season i
  and lag (k-1), \eqn{k=1,2,\dots}{k=1,2,...}.
  The number of rows in m is taken to be the number of
  seasons. The function \code{slMatrix} provides several ways to specify
  the data for the slMatrix object.

	= "ANY")}:

  The indexing method is quite flexible and allows to extract parts of
  \code{slMatrix} objects in a variety of ways. It returns an ordinary
  matrix or, if \code{drop = TRUE}, vector.

  The syntax for indexing is similar to that for ordinary matrices with
  some features specific to the periodic nature of the first index. The
  named parameters are \code{i}, \code{j}, and \code{type}. Both
  \code{i} and \code{j} can be vectors. The interpretation of \code{i}
  and \code{j} depends on \code{type}.

  \code{x[i,j]} (or \code{x[i,j,type="sl"]}) refers to the value for
  season \code{i} and lag \code{j}.
  This is referred to as standard season-lag pair, meaning that the
  elements of \code{i} must be in the range 1,...,d, where d is the
  number of seasons and the lags must be non-negative. Negative indices
  have the usual effect of removing the corresponding elements. A zero
  element for lag is admissible.

  \code{x[i,j,type="tl"]} is similar to "sl" but \code{i} is allowed to
  take any (integer) values. These are reduced modulo the number of
  seasons to the 1,...,d, range.

  \code{x[i,j,type="tl+-"]} This allows also the lags to be negative.

  \code{x[i,j,type="co"]} ("co" stands for "coefficient") This assumes
  that the values for negative lags and lags larger than \code{maxlag}
  are 0. If assignment is attempted for such lags, a message is issued
  and the assignment is ignored.

  \code{x[i,j,type="tt"]} both arguments have the meaning of time. If
  \code{i} and \code{j} are scalars the pair \code{i,j} is converted to
  standard \code{s,l} pair and the value assigned to the relevant
  element. If \code{i} and/or \code{j} are vectors, they are crossed and
  the procedure is done for each pair.

  If several values need to be assigned to the same \code{s,l} pair a
  warning is isssued if these values are not all equal.

  Obviously, whereever negative arguments are allowed, elements to omit
  cannot be specified with negative indices.

\note{

  The current implementation of the indexing is inefficient, I simply
  added features and patches as the need arose. Maybe some day I will
  replace it with \code{C} code.
